Usage:\n\n

1.) a single parameter with NO leading -.\n
\t  This will will then be used as the addition for our configfile. Ie. \`$0 security\` will\n
\t  have us look for ${NAME}-security.{conf,mirror} files.\n\n

2.) using getopt style parameters:\n
\t -a [NAME]   - Same as 1.) above, used for the config files. Default empty.\n
\t -k [TYPE]   - Type of push. all, stage2, mhop. Default mhop.\n
\t -f          - Run from within the mirrorscript ftpsync. Don't use from commandline!\n
\t -h          - Print this help and exit
